about=Quick STEP GEOBIA plugin for QGIS 3 implements STEP, a novel object-based similarity matrix, for assessing both geometric and thematic accuracies of remote-sensing image classification. In contrast to the traditional error matrix, STEP uses samples of classified and reference objects rather than counts of pixels. Moreover, STEP provides four (4) similarity metrics for characterization of classified objects compared with reference objects: (i) shape similarity (S); (ii) theme similarity (T); (iii) edge similarity (E); and (iv) position similarity (P).
